# V+V CSS Code Challenge

Thank you for your interest in working with us at Verbal+Visual. As part of your application, please complete the challenge as outlined below.

For this exercise, you will be building four UI elementsâ€”a set of clickables, a toggle switch, a text input, and some interactive text. Contained in the repo's directories, you will find an HTML file for each as well as videos demonstrating the design. Color palette and font details provided in the HTML files.

Fork this repo and reply back to the email that led you here with a link to your work when you are finished.

The rules are:
1. 30 minutes on each element.
2. Do not modify code between the body tags.
3. No Javascript.

Have fun with this! This is not a definitive evaluation of how awesome you are as a developer, but it will help us better understand how you evaluate a design specifications, work through problems, and put elements together.
